## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
I have looked into five questions of the Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2020 
and analyzed the frequency of answers according to the gender woman or man, exclusively from developers living in Germany. The questions that I have explored were related to educational paths and working conditions and preferences and my target was to explore if one could identify clear different trends between the two genders.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in explaining the individual steps.

There is an additional `.py` file that contains the necessary methods to explore the dataset and create visualizations without resorting to code repetitions.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The results of this analysis are available on a Medium post [here](https://iris-theof.medium.com/who-are-the-women-developers-in-germany-976b195d643a)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data, which were retrieved from the [2020 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020). Feel free to use the code in this repository as you would like!
